# Forecast

Forecast is a quick and dirty way to display a list of Omnifocus outstanding tasks (with a due date) on the command-line. Think of it as the Omnifocus forecast view for your terminal.

### Requirements

* `rb-appscript` - For the Applescript interaction with OmniFocus
* `colorize` - For the color output

### TODO list

* Refactor the classes into their own files
* Create a Gemfile for quicker dependency installation
* Refactor the Omnifocus class for speed
