# Forecast

Forecast is a quick and dirty way to display a list of [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) outstanding tasks (with a due date) on the command-line. Think of it as the Omnifocus forecast view for your terminal. I'm in no way affiliated with Omnigroup, but I like their work.

### Requirements

* `Omnifocus` - Because without it, this won't run
* `rb-appscript` - For the Applescript interaction with OmniFocus
* `colorize` - For the color output

### TODO list

* Refactor the classes into their own files
* Refactor the Omnifocus class for speed
